                    <h1>Terminology</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Learn the key terminology</p>
                    <div><p>

<p>Understanding the DynomiteDB terminology is key to learning and using the technology. Fortunately, DynomiteD has a relatively small technical footprint which means that there are</p>

<p>Dynomite is</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent any time watching Cassandra videos on YouTube or reading blog posts about Cassandra you&rsquo;ll notice that the same term is often used to mean different things. For example, the term &ldquo;row&rdquo; is used to refer to a partition and to the CQL rows within a partition.</p>

<p>In this post, I propose that we (the Cassandra community) start to standardize terminology around CQL and try to limit terms to a single abstraction layer when possible. When a term must span multiple abstraction layers, say from CQL to physical, then it should refer to the same thing.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind I&rsquo;m not trying to make this an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right&rdquo; kind of article. The goal is to improve Cassandra terminology by making it less ambiguous so that we all use the same terms to refer to the same things and to start a discussion on what terminology should be used to discuss Cassandra.</p>

<h1 id="problem:25b0bccbd015cb792a35abd72233e20a">Problem</h1>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the problem? Let&rsquo;s pick one simple term, &ldquo;row&rdquo;. Is the following a correct or incorrect statement?</p>

<p>Range scans across rows are efficient in Cassandra.</p>

<p>I say it&rsquo;s true, you say it&rsquo;s false, but who&rsquo;s right? Actually, we both are given the fact that the community currently uses row to refer to either a partition or to a CQL row (i.e. an abstract row within a partition).</p>

<p>If &ldquo;row&rdquo; refers to a partition, then range scans are not efficient. However, if we are using &ldquo;row&rdquo; to refer to a CQL row, then range scans are efficient.</p>

<p>The cause of this mixed use is well known. Jay Patel (Architect at eBay) has a slide the explains the problem well: &ldquo;The more I read, the more I&rsquo;m confused.&rdquo; Please refer to slide 7 of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jaykumarpatel/cassandra-data-modeling-best-practices" target="_blank">Cassandra data modeling best practices</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of Cassandra, the mixed terminology occurred due to the transition from thrift to CQL. However, CQL is clearly Cassandra&rsquo;s query language moving forward, so it&rsquo;s time to upgrade our wording to simplify communication and help make Cassandra easier for newcomers to learn.</p>

<h1 id="abstraction-layers:25b0bccbd015cb792a35abd72233e20a">Abstraction layers</h1>

<p>This post focuses on the two layers with the most confusing terminology:</p>

<ol>
<li>CQL (logical)</li>
<li>Storage (physical)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="proposed-terminology:25b0bccbd015cb792a35abd72233e20a">Proposed terminology</h1>

<h2 id="cql:25b0bccbd015cb792a35abd72233e20a">CQL</h2>

<p>CQL terminology should be focused on explaining the CQL abstraction layer. Some terms, such as &ldquo;partition key&rdquo; are used in both the CQL layer and the storage layer. However, a consistent use of the term to refer to the same thing in both layers will help avoid ambiguity.</p>

<h1 id="cql-to-relational:25b0bccbd015cb792a35abd72233e20a">CQL to relational</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s popular to show a table that maps CQL concepts to relational concepts. The
mapping of SQL to CQL is designed ease SQL developers into the no-sql world of
Cassandra.</p>

<p>However, the use of SQL-like terminology in CQL can confuse matters as many
terms have very different meaning in SQL vs. CQL. I have found that Cassandra
works more like a database that has only materialized views than it does like a
database with relational tables.</p>

    <tr>

        <td>Achieved via materialized view</td>
        <td>As mentioned above, a CQL table plus partition is conceptually
            closer to a materialized view than a relational table. In a
            materialized view in an RDBMS you would achieve the equivalent of a
            JOIN by denormalizing data. The same concept applies to Cassandra
            where you denormalize data.

<h1 id="summary:25b0bccbd015cb792a35abd72233e20a">Summary</h1>

<p>As a community we all benefit from clear terminology. It makes it easier to understand, learn and communicate about Cassandra. Each term should be used in only one abstraction layer, if at all possible. When a term must be used across multiple layers then it should always refer to the same thing.</p>
