## Description

ARDB provides a Redis API / Redis protocol support and uses LMDB, RocksDB and several other backends.

Integration of ARDB would provide immediate support for LMDB within Dynomite.

## Impact

This feature would allow dynomite users to use LMDB features. Value of this capability is dependent on value users derive from an LMDB backend.
